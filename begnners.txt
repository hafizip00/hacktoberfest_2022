write about HMTL TAGS here
NAV
The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links.
Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.
Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.

MAIN
The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document. The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.

SECTION
The <section> tag defines a section in a document.
